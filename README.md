# Amazon Prime Now Stock Scraper (APNSS)
This is a fairly simple script that will check the stock of the Amazon Prime Now website and return the ammount of units they have of a certain item. In this case it looks for both Nintendo Switch models and returns values for each one.
## Installation
Download the executable APNSS.exe and place it in a directory of your liking. You do not have to worry about the other files on GitHub. After doing that, the program is ready to be ran, there is no extracting or installations to be made.
## Usage
Double click on the executable to start. It will ask you how long you want to wait after getting the stock information. Please, do not use very low numbers since it creates many requests to the website which could be harmful. It is recommended to at a minimum use 5 seconds. Every iteration it will print the time and if there is stock or not onto the console. If there is stock of either system, three beeps will played followed by a Windows Notification [that looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/YcgPodv.png). The notification will keep showing up if there is stock the next time the program checks for it.
